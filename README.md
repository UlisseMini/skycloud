## skycloud

CLI access to [skycloud](https://skycloud.pro) aka free file hosting :)

Basically skycloud give you a ton of free storage but you can't upload till you upgrade to a paid plan, they only enforce this client side so here you go, now you can upload with a free account and get free storage.
